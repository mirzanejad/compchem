moldenizer.py reads orbitals in molden format and creates a text file (with the same name) that contains atomic contributions in perent for each molecular orbital. 
MOldenizer can be used to construct molecular orbital diagrams for arbitrary systems.  

Assuming that molden file is in the same directory: python moldenizer.py filename.molden

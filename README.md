moldenizer.py reads orbitals in molden format and creates a text file (with the same name) that contains atomic contributions in percent for each molecular orbital. 
MOldenizer can be used to construct molecular orbital diagrams for arbitrary systems. Also, the provided quantitative analysis can be used in construction of active space orbitals for multireference correlational methods. 

Assuming that molden file is in the same directory: python moldenizer.py filename.molden
